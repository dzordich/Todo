# Todo

This is a simple to-do list app designed to keep the focus on productivity. The inspiration for this app came from using many to-do apps that were cluttered with far to many features. Tasks don't need tags, or color coding, or locations. A task is binary - either complete or incomplete. This app prioritizes speed and ease of use, and doesn't provide any unecessary features. 

Tasks are grouped in boards, and can be reordered to change priority. You can set due dates and get reminders. Other than that, there's not a whole lot more to it. 

The front end of the app is built with React.js, and the back end is Django and Tastypie.
